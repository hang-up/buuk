# Manifest.json

The heart of Bük is laying on its `manifest.json` file. The manifest is responsible for setting up progressive web application features such as orientation, icons, ... but also for creating the file hierarchy of your markdown files.
The default manifest will follow this structure:
```json
    {
        "short_name": "Bük",
        "name": "A markdown based documentation generator.",
        "sub": "Bük is a fast and simple markdown based static site generator geared towards documentation.",

        "background_color": "#fff",
        "theme_color": "#fff",
        "display": "standalone",
        "orientation": "portrait",

        "start_url": ".",

        "version": "3.0.x",
        
        "icons": [
            {
              "src": "/dist/images/logo.png",
              "type": "image/png",
              "sizes": "512x512"
            }
        ],
        
        "options": {
            "advanced_slugs": true,
            "theme": "default",
            "lang": "en"
        },
        
        "articles" : {                              // All articles to be indexed
            "Category 1": [                         // Category name
              {
                "title": "Article title",           // Article name
                "tags": [                           // Tags to use when searched
                  "tag 1",
                  "tag 2",
                  "tag 3"
                ]
              }
            ]
        }
    }
```

>> This manifest is a web app manifest as well as a Bük specific manifest. As such, only `articles` and `options` will be described here. For other members, please refer to the [Web App Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).

### Options
>> **advanced_slugs**
- `true` (default setting): will generate a slug based on the following pattern: `direct-parent-category-title-of-the-article` (eg. usage-manifest.json).
- `false`: will only take the title of the article as slugs (eg. manifest.json)

>> **introduction**
- `name`: Associates a markdown file as the introduction page. The file must be referenced inside `/docs`

>> **theme**
- `default`: This will reference the `default` theme found in `themeBootstrap.js`. See Bootstrapper section for more details.

>> **lang**
- `en`: references `en` language in `localizationBootstrap.js`. See Boostrapper section for more details.

### Articles

##### File naming convention
**Your markdown (.md) file names must match the slug generated by Bük or defined in `manifest.json`.**
See the options section below to know more about how we auto generate slugs.

>> **Generating slugs**  

By default, Bük will generate a slug for every article indexed in the manifest.json file based on its `title` key.  
If you wish to have a custom slug for an article, simply add a `"slug"` key to your article.
```json
{
    "title": "Article title",   // Article name
    "tags": [                   // Tags to use when searched
        "tag 1",
        "tag 2",
        "tag 3"
    ],
    "slug": "custom-slug"       // Associated .md file must be named custom-slug.md
}
```

>> **Nested categories**  

Bük allows an infinite degree of nested categories. Simply build your hierarchy by naming your markdown files accordingly. 
An example of manifest using nested categories:
```json
{
  "articles" : {
      "Level 0": {
          "Level 1" : {
              "Level 2 Category 1": [
                  {
                      "title": "Article Title",   // level-2-category-1-article-title.md
                      "tags": [
                          "licence",
                          "author",
                          "misc"
                      ]
                  }
              ],
              
              "Level 2 Category 2": [
                  {
                      "title": "Article Title",   // level-2-category-2-article-title.md
                      "tags": [
                          "licence",
                          "author",
                          "misc"
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }
      }
  }
}
```
